I don't have time to run through every artist that
 I like to see if they released new content. 
The only way I can do that is to Google search all 
of them or spend way too much time browsing through music
 services like Spotify or Apple Music. If I don't want 
 to pay to listen to their new content I will have to go out to
  Youtube where they posted it. I want to be able to 
  open my application, set a time frame of the last
   time I was up to speed on my favorite artists, 
   and then their new stuff will show up on the page.

- I plan on using JSTL to output my data
- I will be using Spotify and/or Apple Music API to gather musical data
- I will be using Youtube API to output links to the songs
- If the API can not find a match to the artist that you chose, 
    the application will return an error message
- If there is no new music to be returned, it will output 
    "you are all caught up!"
